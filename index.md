## About Me

I am a first-year Master's student at the School of Computer Science, Peking University, advised by  [Prof. Shanghang Zhang](https://www.shanghangzhang.com/). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence as part of the inaugural cohort of the [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/) at Yuanpei College, Peking University, graduating with the PKU Excellent Graduate Award.

## Research Interests

 My research interests lie in <strong>Robotics Generalization</strong> and <strong>Generative AI</strong> . I am particularly fascinated by how generative methods can empower robots to 
  imagine, perceive, understand, and interact with their surrounding environments. In the future, I aspire to further explore the intersection of generative techniques 
  and robotics, investigating how these approaches can enhance robots' ability to learn and adapt to the complexities of the real world.
